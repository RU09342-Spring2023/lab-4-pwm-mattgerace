The code works by instantiating all the necessary pins, primarily the buttons and the servo pin.  Then,
a timer is generated in order to do PWM.  The capture control registers are set to 20000.  In the increase stage,
the code first checks to see if the value of 20000 is reached, then it continues to count up until it reaches this value
and changes the duty cycle which causes the servo to spin.  If the value is reached or exceeded, it caps the servo.
The decrease interrupt works the same way.
